"""Pure address-topology classification shared by detectors and era cards.

The owner normalizes address spelling at its parsing boundary and keeps three
facts separate: operator-local membership, external destination status, and
the stricter public/global classification.  Consumers select the fact their
contract needs; ``external`` is deliberately not a synonym for public/global.
