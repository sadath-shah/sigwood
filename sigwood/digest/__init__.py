"""digest verb - orient-before-the-hunt.

A digest characterises the dominant shape of a log pile and states facts
about it. It is a peer verb to detect, not a detector. Digest never produces
a Finding and never reaches a verdict.

One summariser module per schema. Each summariser is a function
``summarize(frame) -> dict`` returning the schema-specific body of a
DigestCard. The dispatcher below imports the right module by schema name; to
add a new schema, drop a new module beside conn.py and nothing else changes.

Architectural rail: digest consumes the loaded frame BEFORE the allowlist
filtering seam. Allowlisted infrastructure (resolvers, pollers) is part of
what's in the pile and stays on the sonar. The digest call graph must not
touch build_matcher or AllowlistMatcher.filter_df.
