"""Shared digest stats - the home for primitives that more than one card needs.

Hosts:
  - ``_rate``  / ``RATE_FLOOR``  - fraction-of-events-matching-a-kind statistic
                                   with top-contributor attribution
  - ``_share`` / ``SHARE_GATE``  - concentration-against-total statistic with no
                                   population floor
  - ``select_insights_and_fields`` - shared selection helper that promotes the
                                     top-N speaking gated slots to insights and
                                     returns the leftover slots as fields

Cliff machinery (``_cliff``, ``CLIFF_GATE``, ``CLIFF_DISPLAY_CAP``,
``POPULATION_FLOOR``, ``_format_ratio_cell``, ``_format_ratio_lede``) lives in
``sigwood.digest.conn`` and stays there - that is the established shared
origin and every card already imports cliff helpers from it.

The trigger for factoring into this module is "three identical real uses"
(``_rate``, now imported by dns + syslog + cloudtrail) or "shared by the new
statistic by design" (``_share`` introduced by the cloudtrail source-ip slot
and reusable by any future concentration-against-total slot). Tail
(``_tail`` / ``TAIL_GATE``) stays local to dns.py - one-use primitives do not
belong here yet.
