"""Process-isolation harness for HDBSCAN.fit_predict - Ctrl-C honoured.

Covers sigwood.common.clustering.fit_predict_interruptible and its
helpers. Detector-logic tests live in tests/test_dns_detector.py and
are intentionally NOT extended here - they flip _CLUSTERING_ISOLATE_ENABLED
to False via an autouse fixture and exercise the in-process path.

Worker targets MUST be module-level so they pickle cleanly under spawn.
Nested functions, lambdas, and closures would not survive spawn re-import.
Tests rebind clustering._WORKER_TARGET to the helpers below before
invoking fit_predict_interruptible; the spawn child re-imports this
module (its qualified name is tests.test_clustering_interruptible) and
finds the target by name.

All test data is synthetic numpy - no real network data anywhere.
