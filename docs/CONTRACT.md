# What sigwood keeps stable

This page is for anyone scripting against sigwood: what you can rely on across every
1.x release, what is deliberately free to change, and where the machine-readable
surfaces are.

The README carries a short version of this promise. This is the same promise in full.

## The rule

Existing documented verb names, flag spellings and their value/no-value shape, format
tokens, and config key paths remain recognized throughout 1.x. A rename requires an
accepted alias and a deprecation path; new names may be added at any time. Defaults,
thresholds, calibration, and human-facing wording may change.

A documented key path staying *recognized* is separate from its *value* staying put.
`[detectors.beacon].threshold` will keep being read; what it defaults to may change.

Breaking any of the above means 2.0.

## Verbs

Thirteen, all of which stay recognized:

`hunt` · `auth` · `beacon` · `dns` · `syslog` · `scan` · `exfil` · `aws` ·
`digest` · `graph` · `export` · `init` · `allowlist`

## Flags

One value syntax everywhere: `--flag=value`, and `-f=value` for the short forms.
There is no space-separated form (`--out report.txt`), no attached short form
(`-oreport.txt`), and no boolean bundling (`-vy`).

Eleven flags carry a single-letter short: `-h` `-V` `-v` `-y` `-a` `-q` `-o` `-c`
`-s` `-d` `-f`. `-V` is the only capital and it is `--version`; `-v` is `--verbose`.

The full inventory, with whether each takes a value:

| Flag | Short | Takes a value |
|---|---|---|
| `--help` | `-h` | no |
| `--version` | `-V` | no |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | no |
| `--yes` | `-y` | no |
| `--all` | `-a` | no |
| `--quiet` | `-q` | no |
| `--dry-run` | | no |
| `--no-allowlist` | | no |
| `--utc` | | no |
| `--out` | `-o` | yes (`PATH`) |
| `--config` | `-c` | yes (`FILE`) |
| `--since` | `-s` | yes (`DURATION\|DATE`) |
| `--until` | | yes (`DATE`) |
| `--days` | | yes (`N-M`) |
| `--hours` | | yes (`N-M`) |
| `--detect` | `-d` | yes (`LIST`) |
| `--format` | `-f` | yes (`FORMAT`) |
| `--syslog-source` | | yes (`MODE`) |
| `--zeek-dir` | | yes (`PATH`) |
| `--pihole-dir` | | yes (`PATH`) |
| `--syslog-dir` | | yes (`PATH`) |
| `--cloudtrail-dir` | | yes (`PATH`) |

`--syslog-source` is accepted by `hunt`, `auth`, and `syslog`; among the
single-detector verbs, exactly `auth` and `syslog` own the local system-log lane.

If an ordinary single-valued flag is repeated, the last occurrence wins. `-vv` is the
exception: it is its own registered token rather than two `-v`s, and it selects the
fullest reading level whichever order you write it in — `-v -vv` and `-vv -v` both
behave as `-vv`.

## Output formats

Five tokens stay available and selectable: `text`, `json`, `csv`, `html`, `pdf`.

Two carry machine contracts — `json` and `csv`. The other three are for reading and
their layout may change. Parse the first two.

`pdf` is always a valid token, but *rendering* one additionally needs the optional
native stack (`pip install "sigwood[pdf]"` plus system Pango/HarfBuzz/fontconfig).
Without it the token is still accepted and you get an actionable message, not an
unknown-format error.

## Calling sigwood from Python

Every detector is importable and callable without the CLI:

```python
from sigwood import DetectorContext, Finding, Severity
from sigwood.detectors.beacon import run

context = DetectorContext.unsuppressed(
    logs={"conn*.log*": frame},
    data_window=(start, end),
)
findings: list[Finding] = run(context)
```

`DetectorContext.unsuppressed(logs, *, data_window, config=None, data_sources=(),
home_net=())` builds a context with **suppression off**. Your allowlist is not
applied, so results can be noisier than the same detector run through the CLI — the
name says so on purpose.

The seven callable detectors are `auth`, `aws`, `beacon`, `dns`, `exfil`, `scan`,
`syslog`; each exposes `run(context) -> list[Finding]`.

A `Finding` has eight public attributes: `detector`, `severity`, `title`,
`description`, `evidence`, `next_steps`, `ts_generated`, `data_window`.

`Severity` has four members: `HIGH` (`"H"`), `MEDIUM` (`"M"`), `LOW` (`"L"`),
`INFO` (`"I"`).

`import sigwood` stays light — importing the package does not pull pandas.

## The json feed

A single JSON object, not one object per line:

```json
{
  "sigwood_version": "1.0.0",
  "schema_version": 1,
  "run_summary": {
    "data_window": ["2026-08-01T00:00:00+00:00", "2026-08-01T06:00:00+00:00"],
    "record_counts": {"conn*.log*": 12345},
    "record_labels": {"conn*.log*": "connections"},
    "data_size_bytes": 480000,
    "detectors_run": ["beacon"],
    "detectors_skipped": {},
    "detectors_failed": {},
    "notes": [],
    "data_sources": ["zeek_conn"],
    "detector_methods": {"beacon": {"label": "FFT", "named": true}},
    "requested_span": 604800.0,
    "invocation": "sigwood hunt --format=json",
    "generated_at": "2026-08-01T06:00:01+00:00",
    "suppression": {
      "enabled": true,
      "connections": 0,
      "domains": 0,
      "connection_total": 12345,
      "domain_total": 0,
      "host_rows": 0,
      "host_total": 0,
      "hosts_matched": 0
    }
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "detector": "beacon",
      "severity": "medium",
      "title": "192.0.2.10 \u2192 192.0.2.20:443/tcp",
      "description": "The regular cadence of an automated check-in.",
      "next_steps": ["Check whether this destination is expected infrastructure"],
      "evidence": {"first_seen": "2026-08-01T00:03:00+00:00", "conn_count": 480},
      "ts_generated": "2026-08-01T06:00:01+00:00",
      "data_window": ["2026-08-01T00:00:00+00:00", "2026-08-01T06:00:00+00:00"]
    }
  ]
}
```

That is the complete shape: every run and every finding carries all of these keys.

**Note the case.** `severity` is written **lowercase** in json — `"high"`, `"medium"`,
`"low"`, `"info"` — even though the Python `Severity` members are uppercase.

### run_summary fields

All fourteen are always present. Five can be `null`:

| Field | Type | Nullable |
|---|---|---|
| `data_window` | two UTC ISO strings | **yes** |
| `record_counts` | object of string to integer | no |
| `record_labels` | object of string to string | no |
| `data_size_bytes` | integer | no |
| `detectors_run` | array of strings | no |
| `detectors_skipped` | object of string to string | no |
| `detectors_failed` | object of string to string | no |
| `notes` | array of strings | no |
| `data_sources` | array of strings | no |
| `detector_methods` | object of detector name to `{"label": string, "named": boolean}` | no — but an individual detector's **value** can be `null` |
| `requested_span` | number, seconds | **yes** |
| `suppression` | object of eight fields — `enabled` (boolean) plus `connections`, `domains`, `connection_total`, `domain_total`, `host_rows`, `host_total`, `hosts_matched` (integers) | **yes** |
| `invocation` | string | **yes** |
| `generated_at` | UTC ISO string | **yes** |

Both nested shapes are part of the contract: `detector_methods` values are either
`null` or carry exactly `label` and `named`, and a non-null `suppression` carries all
eight fields. Tests pin both.

`detector_methods` is the one to read carefully: the object itself is always there,
but an individual detector's entry may be `null`.

### finding fields

All eight are always present:

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `detector` | string |
| `severity` | lowercase string — `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info` |
| `title` | string |
| `description` | string |
| `next_steps` | array of strings |
| `evidence` | object |
| `ts_generated` | UTC ISO string |
| `data_window` | two UTC ISO strings |

- `schema_version` is currently **1** and bumps only on a breaking change.
- Existing envelope and field names, and their types, do not break within 1.x.
- `run_summary` carries fourteen fields, listed with their types and null arms in
  the table below. Read the nullable ones defensively.
- **Tolerate new fields.** New keys appear in `run_summary`, in `evidence`, and in
  findings without a schema bump. A consumer that rejects unknown keys will break on
  an ordinary release; that is the consumer's bug, not a contract violation.
- Timestamps in `json` are ISO-8601 **UTC**, always, regardless of display settings.
- Diagnostics and report prose are not parsing contracts even inside a
  machine-readable container. `notes` is a list of human sentences — read it, do not
  pattern-match it.

### Which evidence keys are promised

`evidence` is an open dictionary and most of what it carries is detector-specific
detail that may change as detectors improve. **The keys promised stable are the ones
this page names** — the event-time keys in the table below. Anything else in
`evidence` is informational: useful, but not a contract, and it may be renamed or
dropped without a schema bump.

We would rather promise a small set and keep it than promise everything and quietly
break it.

### Exfil measured evidence

When an `exfil` finding contains `orig_bytes_total`, `resp_bytes_total`,
`orig_share`, or `connection_count`, those values describe only connection rows
where both byte counts were finite and non-negative. They are not a claim about
unmeasured rows for the same pair. The finding description states this once for
people; JSON carries the values in `evidence`, and CSV renders them in `signals`.

## The csv worklist

A remediation checklist, not a lossless export — `json` is the lossless one. One row
per finding, and a fixed ten-column header in this order:

`severity` · `detector` · `finding` · `next_steps` · `description` · `signals` ·
`data_window_start` · `data_window_end` · `status` · `notes`

`status` and `notes` are seeded empty for you to fill. csv is never capped and never
varies with `-v`/`-vv`. Its timestamps are ISO-8601 carrying the display timezone's
offset.

Control characters other than newline — the C0 range, DEL, and C1 — are removed from
every cell before it is written. An embedded newline is deliberately kept, so a
multi-line `next_steps` cell stays intact as a quoted field. A cell whose remaining
first character is `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` is then prefixed with a single quote so a
spreadsheet does not execute it.

## Config

The file is `~/.sigwood/config.toml` (or `/etc/sigwood/config.toml`, or whatever
`--config=` names). These paths stay recognized. New keys may be added; the ones
listed here do not disappear.

- **`[sigwood]`** — `root`, `detect`, `zeek_dir`, `syslog_dir`, `syslog_source`,
  `pihole_dir`, `cloudtrail_dir`, `home_net`, `export_dir`, `report_dir`,
  `output_format`, `warn_above`, `default_window`, `quiet`, `use_utc`,
  `max_findings_per_detector`
- **`[detectors.<name>]`** for each of the seven detectors. The documented tuning keys
  stay recognized; their default values may change.
  - `aws` — `min_events`, `min_scorable_principals`, `burst_gap_seconds`,
    `burst_window_edge_margin_seconds`, `burst_min_firsts`, `burst_high_error_rate`,
    `burst_high_service_count`, `composite_medium_threshold`,
    `composite_low_threshold`
  - `beacon` — `bin_seconds`, `min_connections`, `threshold`
  - `dns` — `min_cluster_size`, `min_samples`, `threshold`, `thresh_high_entropy`,
    `scan_dense_clusters`, `scan_min_high_entropy_fraction`,
    `scan_min_cluster_members`, `scan_min_regdomain_share`,
    `scan_max_members_per_cluster`, `promote_below_gate`, `promote_min_subdomains`,
    `promote_min_nxdomain_fraction`, and the nested
    **`[detectors.dns.pihole]`** (`min_cluster_size`, `min_samples`)
  - `exfil` — `min_outbound_bytes`, `min_orig_share`
  - `scan` — `window_secs`, `horizontal_threshold`, `vertical_threshold`,
    `block_host_threshold`, `block_port_threshold`, `block_state_min`,
    `slow_min_ports`, `slow_min_buckets`, `slow_state_min`
  - `syslog` — `rarity_pct`, `max_count`, `depth`, `sim_thresh`,
    `parametrize_numeric`, `line_trim_limit`, `burst_gap_seconds`, `burst_min_size`,
    `family_min_size`, `reboot_cluster_seconds`, `recognize_transactions`,
    `privileged_programs`
- **`[allowlist]`** — `enabled`, `allowlist_dir`, `domain_patterns`,
  `connection_rules`
- **`[allowlist.lists]`** — a boolean per shipped list. The documented names
  `common`, `devices`, `homelab` stay recognized; new lists may be added.
- **`[[allowlist.entry]]`** — `match`, `comment`, `detectors` stay recognized, and so
  do the two behaviour-bearing `match` kinds and the keys each one reads:
  - `match = "ip_pair"` reads `src`, `dst`, and optionally `dst_port`
  - `match = "dst_port"` reads `value`

  Any *other* key in a stanza is carried as open metadata and is not promised.
- **`[graph]`** — `target_bins`, `top_hosts`, `top_services`, `domain_level`
- **`[export.splunk]`** — `host`, `port`, `username`, `password`, `verify_tls`,
  `export_dir`
- **`[export.cloudtrail]`** — `path`, `egress_warn_gb`, `export_dir`
- **`[export.splunk.query.<name>]`** — the query *name* is yours and is not a
  contract; its leaves are: `spl`, `output_basename`, `export_dir`. (CloudTrail has
  no query table — it synthesises a single implicit query.)

An unknown top-level section is reported on stderr and ignored; the run continues on
defaults.

## Exit codes

- **0** — the run completed. Includes a run that found nothing, and a run where you
  declined the large-dataset confirmation (declining is a choice, not a failure).
- **1** — a failure: bad configuration, an unreadable source, or a detector that
  crashed. A report may still have been written; the code is what tells you the
  night was not clean.
- **130** — interrupted (Ctrl-C).
- **141** — a downstream reader closed the pipe, as in `sigwood hunt | head`.

If you schedule sigwood, branch on the exit code, not on whether output appeared.

## When a finding happened

Every finding carries the run's data window. Most also carry their own event time —
but the key name depends on the finding type, so a timeline script needs to know
which to read:

| Finding type | Key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| beacon | `first_seen` | also `last_seen`, `span_seconds`, `cycles` |
| dns groups and singletons | `first_seen` | also `last_seen`, `span_seconds` |
| exfil | `first_seen` | also `last_seen`, `span_seconds` |
| syslog families, bursts, single rare lines, transactions | `first_seen` | |
| syslog reboots | `reboot_ts` | the reboot instant — a different meaning, kept deliberately |
| aws bursts | `start_time` | ISO-8601 with offset |
| scan | `window_start` | UTC, but written **without** a timezone offset |
| aws ranked summary | *(none)* | a summary of a whole scan, with no single entity |
| dns scan summary | *(none)* | same |

The two summary findings carry no event time by design: they describe a scan rather
than an entity, so there is nothing to timestamp.

## What is not stable

Deliberately outside the contract, and expected to move:

- which findings a given log produces — thresholds move when measurement says so
- severity calibration and scoring internals
- evidence keys this page does not name
- the wording of any human-facing message, including `notes` and `next_steps`
- the layout of `text`, `html`, and `pdf`
- the internals of the `graph` artifact

A tool that promised its findings would never change would be promising to stop
learning.
